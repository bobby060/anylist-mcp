# AnyList MCP Server

This project provides a local server that integrates with the [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) shopping list service and exposes its functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows language models (especially Claude Desktop or Claude Code) to interact with your AnyList shopping lists. Rather than having the LLM call the AnyList API directly, this server wraps common actions (like adding or checking off items) in a way that is more intuitive for the model to use - that is, more like how a human would interact with the service.

Tested on Windows with Claude Desktop, but should also work with Claude Code.

## Features

- **Connect to AnyList:** Authenticate with your AnyList account and connect to a specific shopping list.
- **Add Items:** Add new items to your shopping list with an optional quantity.
- **Check Off Items:** Mark items as completed on your shopping list.
- **Health Check:** A simple endpoint to verify that the server is running.


### Next steps:
- List items on shopping list
- Delete items entirely from shopping list (not just check off)

Note: The API to anylist comes from a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/codetheweb/anylist) by @codetheweb. The only change I made was to remove console.info statements, since the writing to stdout causes issues with local MCP servers.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- An [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bobby060/anylist-mcp.git
    cd anylist-mcp
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables (Only needed for running tests, debugging):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, edit the `.env` file with your AnyList credentials and the name of the shopping list you want to use:

    ```
    # AnyList Credentials
    ANYLIST_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
    ANYLIST_PASSWORD=your_password

    # AnyList Configuration
    ANYLIST_LIST_NAME=Shopping List
    ```

4. **Add to Claude Code**
    Add this json snippet to your claude desktop config file. For information about where to find this, look [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers)

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "anylist": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js"],
            "env": {
                "ANYLIST_USERNAME":"yourusername@youremail.com",
                "ANYLIST_PASSWORD":"yourpassword",
                "ANYLIST_LIST_NAME": "target_list"
            }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Available Tools

The following tools are registered with the MCP server:

-   `health_check`: Check if the server is running.
-   `anylist_connect`: Test the connection to AnyList.
-   `add_item`: Add an item to the shopping list.
    -   `name` (string, required): The name of the item to add.
    -   `quantity` (number, optional): The quantity of the item.
-   `check_item`: Check off an item from the shopping list.
    -   `name` (string, required): The name of the item to check off.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for the AnyList client.

-   **Run all tests:**

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

-   **Run unit tests for the AnyList client:**

    ```bash
    npm run test:unit
    ```

## You can also debug via this command:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node src/server.js
```
